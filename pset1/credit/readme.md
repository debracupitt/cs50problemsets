## 'Credit' Instructions

In credit.c at right, write a program that prompts the user for a credit card number and then reports (via printf) whether it is a valid American Express, MasterCard, or Visa card number, per the definitions of each’s format herein. So that we can automate some tests of your code, we ask that your program’s last line of output be AMEX\n or MASTERCARD\n or VISA\n or INVALID\n, nothing more, nothing less. For simplicity, you may assume that the user’s input will be entirely numeric (i.e., devoid of hyphens, as might be printed on an actual card). But do not assume that the user’s input will fit in an int! Best to use get_long from CS50’s library to get users’ input. (Why?)

Consider the below representative of how your own program should behave when passed a valid credit card number (sans hyphens).

```
$ ./credit
Number: 4003600000000014
VISA
```

Now, get_long itself will reject hyphens (and more) anyway:

```
$ ./credit
Number: 4003-6000-0000-0014
Number: foo
Number: 4003600000000014
VISA
```

But it’s up to you to catch inputs that are not credit card numbers (e.g., a phone number), even if numeric:

```
$ ./credit
Number: 6176292929
INVALID
```
